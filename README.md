# Mario 2D Game Engine

Recreating the NES Mario game using a Java 2D Game Engine. This project utilizes LWJGL, OpenGL/GLFW, Dear ImGui, and Gradle. The main motivation behind this project is to explore the feasibility and complexity of developing a game in the Java programming language.

## Project Description

The 2D Game Engine aims to provide a Java-based game engine capable of recreating the classic NES Mario game. Although the project is currently in its early stages and is quite basic, the intention is to further develop the engine to enable the creation of various other games, not limited to Mario.

## Usage

As the project is still under development, specific instructions on how to use the game engine will be provided in the future. Stay tuned for updates on the usage guidelines.

## Roadmap

Here are the planned features and enhancements for the Mario 2D Game Engine:

- Implement physics engine to handle player movement, collisions, and interactions with the game world.
- Enhance rendering capabilities to support more complex graphics and animations.
- Integrate audio system to provide sound effects and background music.
- Expand level design capabilities by adding support for creating and editing game levels.
- Improve input handling to support various input devices such as game controllers.
- Implement enemy AI for creating more dynamic and challenging gameplay.
- Introduce a scripting system to allow for custom game logic and behavior.
- Optimize performance and improve memory management for better efficiency.
- Add support for saving and loading game states, allowing players to resume their progress.
- Provide documentation and tutorials to help developers understand and utilize the game engine effectively.
